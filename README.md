# Prisoner's Dilemma

Iteration 1 //Once I've learned more I will come back and rewrite this better and continue this process as I learn and grow.

Intepretation of the classic game.

You can choose to cooperate or defect.

This simple program is inefficient, poorly written, classless (in multiple ways), and kind of fun.
You can select 1 or 2 players. 1 player plays against the computer.
You can select the number of rounds you'd like to play in order to increase your score.

        String chart = "\n             Cooperate      Defect\n" +
                       "           __________________________\n" +
                       "          |            |             |\n" +
                       "Cooperate |   (3,3)    |    (0,5)    |\n" +
                       "          |            |             |\n" +
                       "          |____________|_____________|\n" +
                       "          |            |             |\n" +
                       " Defect   |   (5,0)    |    (1,1)    |\n" +
                       "          |            |             |\n" +
                       "          |____________|_____________|\n";
